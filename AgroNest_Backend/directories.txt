In this structure:

app contains the application's core functionality.

api holds the API-related code.
endpoints contains different endpoint files. This separation keeps the endpoints organized.
routes.py ties everything together by assembling the endpoints.
core contains the essential components.
config.py might store configuration settings.
database.py handles database connections.
security.py manages authentication and authorization.
models contains the data models.
main.py is where you run the FastAPI application.

.env is where you might store environment-specific variables.

README.md provides information about your project.

Remember, while this structure is based on conventions and best practices, you should adapt it to the specific needs of your application. Consistency, readability, and maintainability should be your guiding principles. It's also important to document your code and have clear naming conventions for files, classes, and functions.

Ultimately, the structure and organization you choose should help you and your team understand and work on the project more efficiently.
